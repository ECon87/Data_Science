* Statistical test implementations in python
** Normality tests

      - H0: Gaussian distribution v H1: Not a Gaussian distribution.

      - Tests whether two samples have a monotonic relationship.
      - Assumptions:
            1. Obs in each sample are iid.

   4. Chi-Squared Test (~from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency~)
      - Tests whether two categorical variables are related or independent.
      - Assumptions:
            1. Obs used in the calculation of the contingency table are independent.
            2. 25 or more examples in each cell of the contigency table.
      - H0: Gaussian distribution v H1: Not a Gaussian distribution.
** Stationarity tests
   1. Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (~from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller~)
      - Tests whether a time series has a unit root.
      - Assumptions:
            1. Observations are temporally ordered
      - H0: a unit root is present (non-stationary series) v H1: a unit root is not present (stationary series)
   2. Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (~from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import kpss~)
      - Tests whther a time series is trend stationary or not.
      - Assumptions:

      - H0: the timer series is trend-stationary v H1: the time series is not trend-stationary
** Parametric Statsitical Hypothesis Tests

   3. ANOVA (~from scipy.stats import f_oneway~)
      - Tests whether the means of two or more independent are significantly different.
      - Assumptions:
        1. Obs in each sample in iid.
        2. Obs in each sample are normally distributed.
        3. Obs in each sample have the same variance.
